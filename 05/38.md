# Intro to Sorting Algorithms

## Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting is one of the most fundamental of all algorithms in Computer Science.  
  (基本且重要的演算)
- Even though many modern programming languages have built-in sorting functions,  
  it's still a good thing to know how it works.  
  (各語言皆已提供各種sorting的演算方法,但還是需要知道是如何運作的.)
- We are going to learn 6 different sorting algorithms in this course.  
  It's good to know when to use which algorithm, as they excel in some certain cases.  
  (共有六個sorting主題要探討,各有不同的時間複雜度與試用情境.)

該節Sort主題有以下:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
