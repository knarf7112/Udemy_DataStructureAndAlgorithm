# The Idea of Algorithm

## What is Algorithm?

* Algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined,  
  computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve  
  a class of problem or to perform a computation.  
  (有限連續性的定義)
* Easily speaking, algorithm is a step-by-step procedure  
  to solve a problem.
  (用多個步驟來解決問題)

## Examples of Algorithm in real life

* How does Google Map find the shortest path?
